#Python has three built-in numeric data types: integers,
#floating-point numbers, and complex numbers


#Integer
#An integer is a whole number, such as 1, 2, or 3. You can create an integer by assigning an integer value to a variable:

#
x = 10
#You can perform arithmetic operations with integers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:


x = 10
y = 5

# Addition
z = x + y  # z is 15

# Subtraction
z = x - y  # z is 5

# Multiplication
z = x * y  # z is 50

# Division
z = x / y  # z is 2.0


Float
#A float is a number with a decimal point, such as 1.5 or 3.14.
# You can create a float by assigning a float value to a variable:

x = 3.14
#You can perform arithmetic operations with floats, just like with integers:



x = 3.14
y = 2.71

# Addition
z = x + y  # z is 5.85

# Subtraction
z = x - y  # z is 0.43

# Multiplication
z = x * y  # z is 8.5094

# Division
z = x / y  # z is 1.16230366492

#Complex
#A complex number is a number with a real and imaginary part, such as 3 + 4j. You can create a complex number by using the complex() function:


x = complex(3, 4)
#You can perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers, just like with integers and floats:

x = 3 + 4j
y = 2 + 3j

# Addition
z = x + y  # z is (5+7j)

# Subtraction
z = x
