#what is Boolean
#A Boolean value is either True or False. In Python, you can create a Boolean value by assigning
# True or False to a variable:

#Example:

x = True
y = False


#You can use Boolean values in comparisons and logical operations:
x = 10
y = 5

# Greater than
z = x > y  # z is True

# Less than
z = x < y  # z is False

# Equal to
z = x == y  # z is False

# Not equal to
z = x != y  # z is True

#You can use the and and or operators to perform logical operations:
x = True
y = False

# AND
z = x and y  # z is False

# OR
z = x or y  # z is True

#You can use the not operator to negate a Boolean value:
x = True
y = not x  # y is False

#Boolean values are an important part of Python programming, as they allow you to control the flow of your code and make
# decisions based on certain conditions.
