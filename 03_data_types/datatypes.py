#Numbers: Python has three types of numbers: integer, float, and complex. An integer is a whole number,
# a float is a number with a decimal point, and a complex number is a number with a real and imaginary part.

#Strings: A string is a sequence of characters, such as a word or a sentence. You can create a string by
# enclosing a series of characters in single or double quotes.

#Lists: A list is an ordered collection of values that can be of any data type. You can create a list by
# enclosing a series of values in square brackets and separating them with commas.

#Tuples: A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable, which means that you cannot
# modify the values in a tuple once it has been created. You can create a tuple by enclosing a
# series of values in parentheses and separating them with commas.

#Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. You can create a dictionary by enclosing
# a series of key-value pairs in curly braces and separating them with commas.

#Sets: A set is an unordered collection of unique values. You can create a set by enclosing a
# series of values in curly braces and separating them with commas.

#Booleans: A Boolean value is either True or False.


#	Data Type	Try it
x = "Hello World"	#string	
x = 20	#int	
x = 20.5	#float	

x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	#list	
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	#tuple	
x = range(6)	#range	
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	#dict	
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	#set	
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	#frozenset	
x = True	#bool	
x = b"Hello"	#bytes	
x = bytearray(5)	#bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	#memoryview	
x = None	#NoneType
